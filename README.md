## Code Snippet

<img src="./assets/codesnippet.png" alt="codesnippet" />

I chose this snippet because it gave me the most grief. I probably reviewed every lesson we had and more stackoverflow pages that I can remember but after hours of messing around with it, this is how it finally worked correctly.

.

## Change Log

1. Changed the background image. I changed this because I found an image that I liked more and also fit better on the screen.
2. PostMVP - I wasnt able to find an API for team logos, so I grabbed them from giphy and manually implemented them.
3. Player photos - I still plan on finding an api and adding them when a user searches a player.
